    <h2>The Programmer.</h2>
    
    <p>
        Programming is where curiosity turns into creation. I work fluently in C#, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS, and I have built everything from game demos to this website. I am also highly comfortable with tools like Unity, Netlify, GitHub, and Figma, using them as natural parts of how I think through design and development. Even though I am early in my career, I have built a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and full-stack web work. Coding is a space where I never run out of new things to learn, and every skill I pick up leads to another project I am excited to build.
    </p>
    <h2>The Musician.</h2>
    <p>
        Music is my creative outlet and my discipline. I play bass guitar for Stephen Lubera, and being part of a band has taught me how important collaboration and trust are when bringing a song to life. The hours of practice have given me patience, consistency, and the ability to improve through steady repetition. I also manage the band’s social media accounts, shaping how our sound and identity reach people. Being a musician keeps me balanced because it gives me a place to experiment, express myself, and work side by side with others in a meaningful way.
    </p>
    <h2>The Student.</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently studying Games and Interactive Media at Michigan State University, where I will graduate in 2026 with a minor in Computer Science. My coursework includes Python and C++ programming, discrete math, game development in C#, UI and UX design, SQL-based data structures, and full web development. These classes have helped me think critically, solve problems creatively, and approach technology from both an artistic and technical perspective. After MSU, I plan to continue my education with a Master of Science in Cybersecurity at Eastern Michigan University or Grand Valley University. I love learning in every aspect of my life and I do not think I will ever stop.
