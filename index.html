    <h1> Hi, I'm Landon Olesky</h1>
    <h2>I'm a creatuve person in a technical field...</h2>
    <p>
        I am a programmer, musician, and student. I like to think of my self as a jack of all trades, soon to be master of some.
    </p>
    <p>
        My love for programming started when I was in community college, where I took my first coding class. 
        Like most 18-year-olds,  I didn’t know what I wanted to do as a career. 
        That  class introduced me to something I had never seen before. 
        Something I liked AND could make money doing! This lead me to choosing the path I am on now, and to you reading this!
    </p>

        Yes, I am a musician. I play the bass guitar and have been for about 3 years now. It has been my main creative outlet. 
        My favorite thing to do is improvisational jam sessions with my band members. 
        The collaboration skills and discipline I have acquired from this aspect of my life cannot be understated.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I say I am a student, I don’t just mean I have a student ID in my wallet (although I do). 
        I mean I am a student of LIFE ITSELF. 
        I genuinely do believe I will continue to learn for as long as I possibly can.
